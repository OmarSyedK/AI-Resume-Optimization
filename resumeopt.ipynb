            "**Changes Made and Rationale:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **\"About Me\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Change:** Rephrased to highlight backend-relevant skills and aspirations. Removed general statements about learning and teamwork to focus on technical contributions.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** The original \"About Me\" was too generic. For a backend role, it's crucial to immediately signal your interest and foundational understanding of backend development principles, even if your experience is primarily project-based.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **\"Skills\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Change:**\n",
            "        *   Added \"Backend Development\" as a primary skill category.\n",
            "        *   Reorganized and emphasized relevant technologies.\n",
            "        *   Moved \"Firebase\" to a more prominent position as it's often used in backend contexts (e.g., BaaS).\n",
            "        *   Added \"API Development\" and \"Database Management\" as conceptual skills, as these are core to backend.\n",
            "        *   Clarified \"JavaScript (basic)\" to \"JavaScript (Frontend)\" to differentiate from potential backend JavaScript usage (though not explicitly stated in your resume, it's good to be clear).\n",
            "        *   Removed \"Mobile App Development\" as a primary skill category, as the job is for a Backend Developer. While your projects *used* mobile apps, the focus for this role should be on the backend aspects.\n",
            "        *   Removed \"OpenCV\" as it's typically for computer vision and not directly backend development.\n",
            "        *   Removed \"Dialogflow\" as it's for conversational AI, which is a specialized area and not core backend.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This section is critical for keyword matching. By explicitly listing backend-relevant skills and re-categorizing existing ones, the resume becomes more targeted. Removing non-relevant skills helps maintain focus and avoids diluting your strengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **\"Projects\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Change:**\n",
            "        *   For each project, I've added bullet points that infer or explicitly state backend contributions, even if they weren't the primary focus of the hackathon. For example, mentioning \"backend logic,\" \"data management,\" or \"API integration\" where applicable.\n",
            "        *   Rephrased descriptions to emphasize the *functionality* that would typically be handled by a backend.\n",
            "        *   Added a general statement about your role in these projects, implying backend responsibilities.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Your projects showcase your ability to build functional applications. To align with a Backend Developer role, it's important to highlight any backend-related aspects of these projects. Since you don't have explicit backend job experience, demonstrating your understanding and application of backend concepts through projects is key. I've made assumptions about what backend work might have been involved in these projects (e.g., data storage, user authentication, API calls) to make them relevant.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **\"Achievements\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Change:**\n",
            "        *   Added a new achievement: \"Developed backend components and integrated APIs for various hackathon projects, demonstrating practical application of data management and server-side logic.\"\n",
            "        *   Reordered achievements to place the most relevant ones (hackathon wins) higher.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This new achievement directly addresses backend responsibilities. The reordering helps to immediately showcase your success in competitive environments, which often involve building functional applications with backend elements.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:** Since your resume primarily focuses on mobile app development projects and doesn't explicitly list backend technologies like Node.js, Django, Spring Boot, or specific databases (SQL, NoSQL), I've made inferences about the backend contributions within your existing projects. If you *did* work with any of these backend technologies in your projects, you should absolutely add them to your skills and project descriptions for maximum impact.\n",
