            "\n",
            "1.  **\"About Me\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Original:** Focused on general learning, teamwork, and staying updated.\n",
            "    *   **Revised:** Tailored to highlight a proactive approach to AI/ML and practical application. Added keywords like \"AI/ML,\" \"data-driven solutions,\" and \"innovative applications.\"\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This section is the first impression. It needs to immediately signal your interest and aptitude for AI development.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **\"Education\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Original:** Listed GPA and basic coursework.\n",
            "    *   **Revised:** Emphasized the \"AI & ML\" specialization within the B.Tech degree. Added specific AI/ML-related coursework that would be relevant to an AI Developer role, such as \"Machine Learning,\" \"Deep Learning,\" \"Data Science,\" and \"Natural Language Processing\" (assuming these are part of your curriculum or you have knowledge in them). If not, I've kept it general but highlighted the AI/ML focus.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Directly showcases your academic foundation in the core area of the job.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **\"Skills\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Original:** Listed programming languages, mobile dev, web tech, tools, and basic concepts.\n",
            "    *   **Revised:**\n",
            "        *   **Reordered:** Placed AI/ML-specific skills at the top.\n",
            "        *   **Expanded:** Added more specific AI/ML skills like \"Machine Learning,\" \"Deep Learning,\" \"Data Analysis,\" \"Model Training,\" \"Model Evaluation,\" \"Computer Vision\" (given your OpenCV usage), and \"Natural Language Processing\" (if applicable).\n",
            "        *   **Clarified:** Specified \"Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)\" to show practical library usage.\n",
            "        *   **Grouped:** Created a dedicated \"AI/ML Concepts\" subsection.\n",
            "        *   **Removed/De-emphasized:** Mobile and basic web technologies were moved lower or slightly de-emphasized to keep the focus on AI.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** This is crucial for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and hiring managers. It needs to clearly list the technical proficiencies required for an AI Developer role.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **\"Projects\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Original:** Listed project names and a brief description, highlighting hackathon wins.\n",
            "    *   **Revised:**\n",
            "        *   **Quantified/Detailed:** For each project, added bullet points that describe the *AI/ML techniques or functionalities* used. For example, \"Developed a therapeutic chatbot using NLP techniques,\" \"Implemented image recognition for symptom analysis,\" \"Utilized machine learning models for predicting allergic reactions,\" \"Designed a rehabilitation companion leveraging AI for personalized exercises.\"\n",
            "        *   **Keyword Integration:** Incorporated terms like \"AI-powered,\" \"ML models,\" \"NLP,\" \"Computer Vision,\" \"data analysis,\" \"predictive modeling.\"\n",
            "        *   **Impact/Outcome:** While wins are good, focusing on the *technical contribution* to the project is more important for an AI role.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** Projects are your proof of concept. They need to demonstrate your ability to apply AI/ML principles to solve problems, not just that you won a competition.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **\"Achievements\" Section:**\n",
            "    *   **Original:** Listed hackathon wins and SIH finalist.\n",
            "    *   **Revised:**\n",
            "        *   **Contextualized:** Added a brief mention of the project name for clarity, especially for the SIH finalist.\n",
            "        *   **Prioritized:** Kept the most relevant achievements at the top.\n",
            "    *   **Why:** While achievements are good, the \"Projects\" section is where you detail the *how* and *what* of your AI work. This section serves as a concise summary of recognition.\n",
